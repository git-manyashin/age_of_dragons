small bits of a real-time strategy game called "Age of Dragons"

Object-Oriented Programming, or "OOP", is a pattern for (allegedly) writing clean and maintainable code.

Admittedly, not everyone agrees that object-oriented programming is the best way to write code, but, to be a good engineer, you should at least understand it.

Throughout this course, we'll be coding small bits of a real-time strategy game called "Age of Dragons". Players control armies of humans, elves, orcs, and dragons in top-down battles. It's similar to Age of Empires or StarCraft.
